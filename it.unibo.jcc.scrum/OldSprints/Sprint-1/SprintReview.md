This sprint pointed out that the motion of the available robot is not accurate enought 
for the purpose of the project. A new Sketch uniboControlGrid.ino has been developed allowing 
more precise rotation and  forward movement by using a grid printed on paper and the 
line-follower sensor which is built-in in the mBot.
